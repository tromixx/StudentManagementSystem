# Student Management System

The **Student Management System** is a comprehensive project designed to showcase advanced C# concepts while building a functional web application. The system tracks students, their courses, grades, and enables administrators to manage registrations, assignments, and performance tracking.

---

## Problem Statement
The goal is to implement a system that allows:
- **Student Registration:** Add and manage student profiles.
- **Course Assignments:** Assign students to courses and manage course details.
- **Performance Tracking:** Record and calculate student grades, generating final grades for each course.

This project serves as a practical way to apply advanced C# programming techniques.

## C# Concepts and Techniques Applied
This project leverages advanced C# concepts, such as:

1. **Core C# Features:**
   - Classes, methods, properties, and interfaces.

2. **Generics:**
   - Generic collections for managing data (e.g., `List<T>`).

3. **Delegates and Events:**
   - Implementing events for notifications and updates.

4. **OOP Principles:**
   - Encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.

5. **LINQ and Querying Data:**
   - Querying and filtering data efficiently.

6. **Exception Handling:**
   - Gracefully handling errors and edge cases.

7. **Asynchronous Programming:**
   - Utilizing `async/await` for non-blocking operations.

8. **Dependency Injection:**
   - Injecting services into controllers and other components.

9. **Design Patterns:**
   - Applying patterns like Repository, Singleton, and Factory.

10. **SQL Integration:**
    - Using Entity Framework Core to interact with the database.

11. **Security:**
    - Implementing role-based access control and user authentication.
